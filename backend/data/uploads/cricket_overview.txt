Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players.
The game originated in England and is now popular in countries such as India,
Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa.

There are three main formats of cricket:
Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20).

Test cricket is played over five days and is considered the longest and
most traditional format of the game. Each team bats twice, and there is no
limit on the number of overs.

One Day Internationals are limited to 50 overs per team and typically last
around eight hours. ODIs are commonly played in international tournaments
such as the Cricket World Cup.

Twenty20 cricket is the shortest format, with each team limited to 20 overs.
T20 matches usually last about three hours and are known for aggressive
batting and fast-paced gameplay.

Major international cricket tournaments include the ICC Cricket World Cup,
the ICC T20 World Cup, and the ICC World Test Championship.

Cricket players are generally categorized as batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders,
and wicket-keepers. Each role plays a specific part in the team's strategy.
